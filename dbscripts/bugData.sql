As recently as June 2002, the beetle was identified in Windsor, Ontario and in the southeast portion of the state of Michigan. In less than a decade, it became a well-known problem insect.  It is native to Asia, found locally in parts of Japan, the Koreas, China, Mongolia, and Russia.  A few beetles likely hitched a ride on cargo during shipping and that is when trouble on the North American continent began.  The Emerald Ash Borer is a highly invasive species, capable of populating a large area in a very short period of time.  It is also highly recognizable thanks to its metallic green coloring. The insect makes no distinction between wild areas and landscaped growth, attacking the leaves and bark of the Ash tree species wherever it happens to grow.Emerald Ash Borers  EABs  are related to native species of North American tree borers. They all share some similarities in how they feed, mate, and otherwise operate in adulthood.  Adults appear in the late spring months and into early August.  One generation lives per year, but it can wreak havoc in little time if left unchecked. The adults that emerge from the tree trunks leave a small, visible D shaped hole in the bark of the Ash tree.  They proceed to feed off of the tree s foliage before mating several weeks later. Upon mating, the female beetle can lay upwards of 50 to 100 eggs on the surface of the tree, allowing the larvae to easily begin boring into the tree once they are born.  Larvae dig into the area just under the bark and continue boring tunnels while feeding on the sapwood inside the tree.  This draining of tree fluids continues from the summer season into the fall. The death of the tree is caused by dehydration and starvation.  The small tunnels block or destroy the xylem in the tree trunk which allows water to move up the tree.  Ash trees that are infected and impaired will have seasons where only a few branch cluster grow leaves, while other parts are bare.  Suffering Ash trees will try to grow new shoots from the base of their trunks in an effort to stay alive.  Ash trees offer a tremendous amount of natural beauty to neighborhoods.  They are an important part of the temperate forest ecosystem and are harvested for use. Targeting the larvae is instrumental in stopping the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer, and the only known solution to stop them is the removal and destruction of all infected trees. This usually results in an entire neighborhood s treescape changing because Ash trees were popular decades ago in urban and suburban planning.  In many places, this species alone was planted for miles.  Now block after block loses shade and character in an effort to stem infestations.Quarantines of known infected areas and trees is currently ongoing throughout many states and provinces. It is thought that the presence of Woodpeckers might be an indication of infestation because Woodpeckers seem enjoy hunting the larvae under the bark.

Nests are expanded by these workers using saliva and vegetation, and many combs are built into the colony in short time.

Black legs have yellow feet. Antennae are black.  All are hunters of caterpillar.  Females generally look for abandoned nests from other types of wasps; it is easier than building one from mud.  Once a nest is obtained, see hunts down a caterpillar, only paralyzing it.  She brings it back to the nest and packs it inside a cell with a fertilized egg.  Once the egg hatches, the wasp larva eats away at the caterpillar, eventually killing it.  The lava pupates and emerges as a winged adult. Potter Wasps are not aggressive and generally leave people alone.  They may build nests close to human habitats, which could cause more encounters between people and the insect, so removing piles of wood from the exterior of the house can help prevent a population from growing uncomfortably close.

It is more reddish in color just after a blood feeding. They are only 4mm to 6mm in length and can be difficult to spot on dark bedding or mattresses. Antennae are present and appear quite thin and segmented. Short stubby legs complement the short - almost unseen - stubby, useless wings. Bed Bugs enjoy the warmth and constant food supply that a mammal host offers. During the day, they hide in crevices.  At night they come out of hiding to feed.  They suck the blood out from their host to mature into adulthood. The bites themselves are not painful so a human host usually remains sleeping through the night.  A Bed Bug will bite its human host, drink some blood, then move a little and bite a new place. This repetitive behavior results in huge areas of afflicted skin.  Bed Bugs can survive without food for 12 to 15 months. They will travel a great distance for a meal. To reproduce, males inject sperm directly inside the female s abdomen where eggs are fertilized.  A female can lay up to 300 eggs in her lifetime.  These eggs are very small and white, but are still visible on a mattress for those carefully looking for them. Many generations of Bed Bugs can be born in a year which means they can reproduce quite rapidly in an area and spread to surrounding areas, quickly inhabiting other mattresses. To check for Bed Bugs, uncover the mattress by removing all the bedding, sheets, and any mattress cover.  If staying in a hotel or vacation rental, do this mattress check BEFORE unpacking. This limits exposure to your belongings should you find evidence of Bed Bugs and need to leave the room permanently.   Visually scan all edges and seams for the brown bugs, their tiny white eggs, small spots of blood  from previous victims , and brown spots of fecal matter left by the bugs. Check the box spring beneath the mattress as well. Unfortunately Bed Bugs do not just stay on mattresses in bedrooms. They can walk around and hide in furniture crevices or on clothing, but are more likely to be in a bed, closer to a food source.  Because of their mobility, however, people may unwittingly transfer Bed Bugs to new locations. Immaculate housekeeping cannot stop guests from bringing in new bug populations.If you have been bitten by Bed Bugs, seeking medical attention can help treat the symptoms  swelling, redness, intense itching  and make your recovery more comfortable.

It also has four tight tufts of yellowish-white hairs  that look like  pom poms  on its dorsal side near the bright red head.  These hairs are barbed, making them difficult to remove from skin. Two clusters of long black quills extend from either side of the head. Beneath the array of black and white hairs is a yellow-and-black striped body that ends in another cluster of long brownish-black hairs at the tip of the abdomen.  By comparison, the adult form seems dull.  Adults, however, do have remarkable feathery antennae and tufts of hair on their legs. They are on the wing year-round in warmer regions. Adults and larvae can be found in forested areas.  Both deciduous and evergreen trees are host plants.  In northern areas, this species has caused damage on Christmas tree farms.  Females are flightless and stay near their own empty cocoons.  Eggs are laid on it and covered with a secretion to protect them.  Shortly after doing this, the female moth dies. The eggs overwinter and caterpillars emerge in the spring.  After growing, the spiky caterpillar weaves a white cocoon around itself that resembles a white ball of laundry lint with some long black hairs woven throughout it. After pupating for a couple of weeks, the adult emerges. ', '', TRUE);;

They usually roam on the body surface before settling on a suitable bite site.  Sometimes they fall off the host before finding one. They have months of patience, however, and will wait for a host on blades of grass, plant leaves or other perches.

Once captured, the robber fly will stop at a branch or leaf and use its stiff mouth to pierce the body of its victim and then suck out the victim s insides.

They eat tree leaves, leaving only the main vein and petiole behind.  This damage is visible as more sunlight gets through and the tree canopy begins to look like it is disappearing.   Heavy feeding in the early summer by a large number of caterpillars can completely defoliate a tree.  Without leaves, a tree must resort to its food stores to survive until a new batch of leaves can grow.  Unfortunately, by the time new leaves grow, another batch of larvae hatch and eat away at them, though not as vigorously as the early generation. After a few years of this level of stress, trees die.Satin Moth adults emerge in summer.  Males and females mate in mid-summer, and females lay light green eggs in oval-shaped groupings on leaves and branches among the poplar trees.  About a month later, these eggs hatch and larvae begin to feed on leaves until they prepare for winter.  They move to the tree trunk and wrap silk around themselves to protect them from the cold winter months. They emerge from these cocoons in spring to continue eating and developing.  It is this group of caterpillars that does the heavy damage to tree foliage.  Once they have matured enough, they pupate, becoming a new generation of adults that produce offspring in late summer.

Another mode of infection happens when adult female Carolina Pine Sawyers create holes in tree bark in which to lay fertilized eggs.  The nematodes can enter the tree through these openings as well. Pine wood nematodes feed on phloem and xylem tissue.  Xylem is the vascular tissue that transports water upward throughout the tree. Phloem transports nutrients up and down the tree. Destroying either tissue disrupts movement of necessary elements that keep a tree alive. Over time, these worms cause the leaves to wilt and the tree to dry up.  This results in a slow tree death.

Controlling the spread of the pine wood nematode requires identifying infected trees, cutting them down and immediately burning them. Because Carolina Pine Sawyer Beetles develop in about two months, its larvae and adult beetles may share the same tree.  Seeing an adult on a trunk means the tree, though healthy in appearance, may already be infected with the nematodes.

Females have a long curved ovipositor protruding from the abdomen.  It is not a stinger, though it looks like one.  Ovipositors are used to deposit fertilized eggs deep into the soil. Eastern Shieldbacks are not picky eaters and consume a variety of plant matter and insects.  They are found in the eastern part of the U.S. in forests and woodlands where they forage.  Though they can t fly, their strong legs allow them to leap quite a distance when threatened. ', '', TRUE);;

Leaves and sometimes fruits of soybeans, lettuce, tomato, sweet potato, peanut, and vegetables in the cabbage family are dietary options.  Tobacco, cotton, goldenrod, and other low-growing plants are also welcome items for dinner. Young caterpillars feed on the lower foliage of the plant and move upward and outward as they grow. Scarring from feeding on the skin and tissues of fruit creates blemishes.  The large amount of defoliation that a population of caterpillars can inflict has rendered them serious agricultural pests. Adults are migratory, moving north in the warm months to reestablish populations that didn t survive the cold winter. Two or more broods can be produced each growing season, so populations can quickly establish themselves in an area.The adult moth is brown with a variety of patterns on its forewings.  It looks similar to the Common Looper, but is more bronze and copper-colored. Two white spots - one solid, the other filled - are clearly visible on each forewing.  The bottom of the forewing is gray and brown and these colors bleed into each other like watercolors.  A tuft of hair near the head rises up like a giant collar.  The top part of the furry brown abdomen has an orange patch of hair. The larva is green with thin white stripes running down the length of the body on top and on the sides.  Short white bands cross each segment.  Tiny black dots run along the sides.  The tail end is wider and thicker than the head and rest of the body. Soybean Looper caterpillars form loops, or rings, with their bodies as they crawl across stems and branches.  The wide rear end is brought up right behind the head, bending the body into a complete circle, just before the head stretches forward.  Look for this species in fields and farms on host plants.

These types of spiders hunt in turf, backyard lawns, and grassy fields where narrow bodies and linear coloring help hide or disguise them among their prey.
